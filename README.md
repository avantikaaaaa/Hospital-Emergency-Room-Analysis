# Improving Patient Satisfaction in Emergency Room Services
# **Introduction**

Patient satisfaction is a crucial indicator of healthcare quality and is directly linked to the overall success and reputation of healthcare institutions. Currently, hospital's emergency room (ER) services have a **Patient Satisfaction Score of 5/10**, which is significantly below the desired benchmark. This score reflects the patients' perceptions and experiences with the care they receive, and a low score can have far-reaching implications.

# Business Task 
To enhance operational efficiency and provide actionable insights into emergency room performance.I have used Power BI which will enable stakeholders to track, analyze, and make data-driven decisions regarding patient management and service optimization.
